## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- How to add an image to an anchor tag
- How to display an icon overlay on hover/focus using the `::before` and `::after` pseudo-elements and the `position: absolute` property
- Use of the `transition` property for simple hover/focus animation
- That we can apply multiple `box-shadow` properties

### Continued development

I'd like to learn more about the different CSS animations, as well as other use cases of pseudo-elements.

### Useful resources

- [CSS box-shadow] from MDN (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/box-shadow) - Has good explanation and examples of the `box-shadow` property
